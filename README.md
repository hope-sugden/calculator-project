# **Calculator Project**
_This is our second project on the _nology course and our first JavaScript project._
_We were challenged to make a fully working calculator and could design it how we like._
_I have used HTML, SCSS and JavaScript._
_This is the link to the calculator https://hope-sugden.github.io/calculator-project/_

## **Operations**

This calculator supports following basic operations

### Addition
### Subtraction
### Multiplication
### Division
### Percentage

## **User Guide**

### The 'C' button will clear the whole display to start a new equation.
### If a second operation is pressed, the first equation will calculate and the total will display in the top display box followed by the next operation sign.
### Once the equals button is pressed, the result will apear in the second display box. 
### The change sign button will change the sign of the last number in the display. 
### The percentage sign needs an operator to work. i.e. 100 * 10% will calculate 10% of 100.

## **Improvements**

### I need to cap the number of digits that can be displayed in the display boxes. Currently they overspill out of the box outside of the calculator. 
### The decimal point should only be able to be pressed once within a number.
